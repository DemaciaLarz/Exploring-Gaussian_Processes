# Exploring-Gaussian_Process
Implementing a Gaussian Process (GP) from scratch over a series of notebooks.

# Motivation
Baysean modeling allows one to capture the degree of the models certainty in parameters. Instead of having but a sparse classification vector and scalar parameters encoding any lingering information from the forward propagation, imagine having each parameter represented by a probability distribution.
